# Sym2-Dihedral

This repo contains multiple functions written in PARI/GP about modulars forms, bernoulli numbers and L function. More precisely, on the trace of the symetric-square L function and dihedral congruences of modular forms. This code was written as part of my master thesis.

List of files :

* trace.gp : functions about the trace of the Symmetric square L function as define by Dummigan and Heim;
* dihedral.gp : functions about dihedrals congruences on modular forms;
* misc.gp : miscealleneous functions about p-valuation of Bernoulli numbers and modular forms.

In a gp session, after reading a file, you can type <?? name_of_file> to obtain more information about the file.
